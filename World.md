## Adventure
### Session 1
#### Date Start: March 30th
#### Date End: March 30th
Started my adventure in [[Bitrashire]] where I stayed at [[The Groggy Wheel]]. Met barkeep [[Catherine Elderton]] who served my food and drink. Tipped her a silver for a good meal and she treated me to a free ale. She suggested I start making my way to [[Gilcra]] if I want to sell my wine to people with money. The road rumbles and dust is flying everywhere on the road outside the tavern. When it settles, a massive lizard creature [[Bulette]] is left looking aggressively for its first target... [[20220330_01]] 

The group meets for the first time and Dorvik offers to buy dinner for all with the intention of talking about the happenings. Everyone is still unknown, Bisreigh told the group to stay put but no one but Carric and the naked Elf listened. Carric sat down to wait for Bisreigh to return, while the unknown Elf followed Bisreigh. Bisreigh town cried that the threat was taken care of and no longer any danger. Bisreigh heads home after talking to the town smith and informs him that there were now dead lizards available for carving. Following that, she heads home to visit with her mom. The naked elf runs into Bisreigh in front of her house... naked Elf introduces herself as Aya. Bisreigh returns to the battlefield with Aya on the back of her boar to see Carric is sitting in the field waiting for her to finish off a bottle of rum. Bisreigh and Aya head back to the tavern on the boar together. They are now all together, sitting down and discussing the goings on. During  general discussion of first introductions, [[Ierkash]] stumbles into the tavern blooded, right arm missing. Announces to Bisreigh that there is trouble. Speaks of a glowing stone floating above a tiny pond. The "thing" was so fast, that it took his arm in a flash, the creature took on the shape of an orc.. Told him, anyone that comes near will not be leaving in one piece. Aya heals some of his damaged body, although unable to recover his arm. [[Verboten Lush]] is the location where his described events took place. Weird location, hours can seem like days. Lost his arm in a flash, felt like a warm hug. It all happened so fast. Claims the location is off to the west. Been less than 2 days since the incident. Claims to have been soul searching and meditating. Aya claims she could track the way back to where he was through her wolf form. 

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 2
#### Date Start: March 30th - 3pm
#### Date End: March 31st - arrived at lush around 10am, lost track of time inside the Lush
Ierkash finishes up telling the group about his encounter and decides to head off. [[River in the Night]] buys another round and [[Xan Taramor]] decides to clean up his tea. River claims he's just in town for some supplies. [[Carric Nightbreez]] is in town to lend [[Bisreigh Dahvve]] some current events. [[Aya]] pressures [[Dorvik]] for some of his past and decides to insight check to see if his answer is true. Which he told her true that he has always been good with a bow and decided to sell wine to take as much wine off some rich folk. After much food and drink, the group decides that they are too tipsy to continue the evening as they are and go their separate ways. Bisreigh, Aya, Carric all end up at Bisreigh's house. River, Dorvik, and Xan stay at the tavern. Dorvik gets left with the bill and settles up with Catherine - 1GP for all of it. Bisreigh and her mom have an evening talk and Aya sneaks out in the middle of the night to communicate with nearby wolves. Trying get any information she can about the events taking place in the Lush. End of night *long rest*

// Start of new day March 31st //

Xan started the day early, by practicing early in the morning, around 430am. River got up around the same time to check the bar and help tidy up if it was still a mess. When he saw that it was picked up and clean, he headed back out to the site of the Bulette attack. His attempt is to gain any sort of additional knowledge or insight into what may have caused them to come up and attack. Wasn't able to really gain any new knowledge, the Bulette bodies were cleaned up by the gnomes so there were no real remains to study. He then headed back to the tavern, pulled up a chair and begin writing in his journal. Dorvik starts his day with a routine of stretches and light body weight workout. Produces a small orb in front of him to tell him the weather for the next 24 hrs. Determines that it'll be sunny with no rain in the future. Heads to the tavern to grab coffee and breakfast. River and Xan catch up with each other and share a table for breakfast and conversation. Dorvik sees them and sits for conversation. Talk about the events from yesterday and the folks that didn't stay at the tavern. Bisreigh wakes up with Aya in wolf form laying across her. Carric wakes up, packs his sack, and begins drinking from his flask. They have morning conversation, Bisreigh's mother asks Aya to change out of wolf form to show herself. The group makes their way back to the tavern to run into the rest of the group. Discussions about pursuing happenings in the Lush. Xan, River, and Dorvik decide to check out the local general store for personal reasons. River purchases some baking goods while Xan and Dorvik purchase a healing potion each. Bisreigh and Aya visit the local brothel and talk to [[Susanna]], worker at the brothel. She mentions for 350GP that she will get her the diamond we're looking for. The group comes back together and decides to head toward the lush to begin their first adventure together. 

The group starts out with Aya tracking the scent left on the bandage from [[Ierkash]], with Xan's companion flight above keeping an eye out for any danger. Several hours pass, Aya tracking the scent the whole way. As they approach the Lush, they see just how dense the Lush really is. Vision dropping from 20-30 feet in some places. River is familiar with the general location, but is far enough away from his typical path that he doesn't know where we're at. As the group gets about 300 or so feet into the Lush, it grows dark pretty quickly. The thick tree coverage is blocking a large amount of the sun, giving the appearance of early night even though the group knows it's afternoon. River takes an opportunity to find edible herbs and mushrooms. He is able to locate about a pound of "veggies". Aya does appear to loose the scent for a moment, but does quickly pick it back up with a quick sniff of the wind (N20 perception check=27). The group begins to wonder how long they've been traveling around the same time that Aya has now completely lost the scent. A mist/fog begins to form around the top of the canopy. Two pools of stagnant water lead into a deep dark area of the lush. Taking in his surroundings, Dorvik is unable to pickup anything that would look like a natural "woods", almost as if the woods were created strategically. 

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 3
#### Date Start: March 31st - arrived at lush around 10am, lost track of time inside the Lush
#### Date End: UNKOWN
Looking around, there's not much to see. The path that we came in through has disappeared and is no longer visible. All we see around us is tree after tree. A dense fog has surrounded us to add to the darkness. The marks that River has been making have been lost and even the most recent marking left behind is lost in the dense woods. Xan sent his bird Fion off to scout, but even they are unable to make out anything of detail, with Xan loosing sight of Fion almost instantly within 3ft. The sense that Xan receives from Fion is that of terror and immediate fear. With the reaction of Fion, Xan decides to take control of Fion and takes view through their eyes. However, still unable to see anything through the fog. As the fog breaks traveling skyward, seemingly out of the blue, Xan senses the a large wing flap and his connection to Fion breaks. While proceeding forward, the path we travel begins to widen out with two pools of stagnant water sitting in the center of the opening we come across. Nothing in particular stands out with the clearing and the group continues moving forward. The group continues traveling, 15, 30, 45 minutes until we come to another clearing with a smooth stone. The stone has a worn half closed eye and new directions have opened up around us. One path each heading in opposite directions, North, South, East, and West. The group discussed which direction to take, unable to determine a solution, the group decided to roll for direction. The fate of the dice directed the group South. The group comes across a smooth slab of stone with moss. River begins picking at the moss, however he continued to not sense anything abnormal about the stone. Just a smooth stone. While the River is investigating the stone, Lil Peep, Carric's bird flies off to the West to investigate that direction. After direction from Carric, the group decides to head in that direction. After a period of time, the group approaches an old dilapidated shack. The shack is worn and the front door is missing. Aya and River decide to approach the shack. They can see that the busted out door seems to have rotted off of hinges and fell. Aya announces her presence and asks if anyone is around. No response but she see scraps of cloth, leather, and what appears to be used scraps laying about. Aya calls out and asks why are you watching us. A single blade of grass points back to the shack. Aya follows it's direction and heads back into the shack. River picks up some scraps and hears a small magnifying glass hit the ground. He picks up the magnifying glass and looks through it. He does notice that the handle on the door is in pristine shape, almost as it has never been touched. Aya brings the ___ to Xan to look at the object and he is able to detect with certainty that it is magical. Unable to actually identify anything in particular, the group continues heading south. The group comes across more water and old fish traps. The traps have become warn falling apart. The pools appear to be 8-10 ft deep. Aya asks if anyone else wants to try the magnifying glass, handing it over to River. River doesn't notice anything in particular with it and states that he doesn't seem to be able to make it work as well. After time pass a much shorter duration, what felt like 5 minutes, the group comes across another intersection. The group begins to hear voices of children laughing and playing, only we can see no people around. The group feels the need to take a nap, if only for a little. Everyone in the group that is not an elf, begins to fall to sleep (all passed the check), although they shake it off and are able to snap out of it. Shaking that off, the group decides to try South. The path continues for 15/20/25 minutes, longer than the rest. This time the opening appears to be a circular plateau shaped by the bones of dead animals. There is no path to pursue beyond this, as the woods dead end at this point. Aya, Xan, and River investigate the area to find out what the bones came from, if they were eaten animals, or what could have caused this. Unable to come to any conclusion, the group heads north. This time upon entry, no voices of children. Xan asks Carric if he would like to send Lil Peep out and in about 5 minutes, the connection to Lil Peep has been lost. Within a few minutes, Lil Peep returns and the group heads in that direction. A new intersection is made of worked stone. Paths leading out in the directions of North South and East. Aya decides to check out the stone with the magnifying glass. The glass lights up while using it. She is unable to see anything in particular and when she stops looking, the magnifying glass dulls itself out again. Xan speaks up to do the same check, except this time the glass does not glow. Dorvik decides to take a look, glass does not glow, and no new information is gained. The group heads South and eventually find that the path continues to the East. The sounds of the birds have sort of quiet out and fade as they continue the path. The path continues East, although the topography has changed. To continue any further would require the group get their feet wet as a pond begins to take up the path. Again noticing that the birds have quieted. The path proceeds, the group is back on dry ground. The road now turns to the north. Nothing looks the same, but the smell of rot is overwhelming and sharp. Continuing North, a new intersection is revealed and at a crossroads, all directions are available. At one end, a broken tower stands fallen and leaning to the East. Peering into the tower, some straw is present, as is a pan, a few logs, a destroyed fireplace, and in the center of the tower room is a rotting corpse. Just outside the outstretch hand of the corpse are two cubes. Xan takes the glass and goes in to investigate the corpse and dice. The dice have skulls instead of normal pips. Xan takes the glass and takes a look at the dice. The dice still appear as they did before and doesn't really get anything new from them. River opens the front door, no resistance and opens right away. River enters the room with Xan and attempts to role the skull printed dice, although Xan protests. Xan takes the time detect if they are magic and does. River still wants to roll and does so. River rolls and with a small glow, he rolled a 3&3 for a total of 6, gaining 6 temp HP (although he doesn't tell the group and slips them in his pocket, although Dorvik catches him keeping them). Aya communicates with the grass and again single blades of grass point in directions, however one points more obviously to the North. The group heads west, besides some oddly shaped landscape, there's nothing of interest here. Aya and River try to find anything unnatural about the area, but come up empty. The group heads back and instead heads north from the tower. It's a good 30 minute walk. We see soft lights dancing about the path and are able to head either North or East. The group decides to head North, from here we can head South or East. In this area, there is a small alter in the middle of the area. We do hear bugs flying around and getting bit by mosquitoes. The alter does not have any markings, insignia, letters, but it was definitely placed there with purpose. River approaches the stone alter and finds a few dark stained brown spots from old blood. Aya decides to drip blood onto the alter, at which point all mosquitoes are drawn to it. River lights a bonfire killing off all of the mosquitoes. Bisreigh places flowers on the alter and one of them turned a deep red crimson color. That's all that seems to happen and the group travels on. Along the travels, the group comes across a pond. Bis approaches and notices that the pool is 60 ft deep with what appears to be a shimmering "stone" directly on the bottom. The group decides to give up and keeps moving. We come across thick brambles, Aya asks them to part a path and the group continues. The group takes some damage from them, but is able to continue. After proceeding further, we managed to return to the place where we started with the stone eye. The group is able to move through paths known and find a new way to get to where we know we have not been. The group is hearing loud birds and see a figure in the deep fog. The figure says to the group "All of those, who enter my presence shall perish!" The figure in the background appears to be 7ft tall, 300 lbs, pure muscle, grayish skinned half orc, standing in the deep fog. Off to the side, a small orb can be floating about 10 ft off the ground over a pool of water.

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 4
#### Date Start: UNKOWN
#### Date End: Evening
The group starts the session in combat, having just rolled initiative... [[20220420_02]]
The fight was a grueling, drag out brawl that brought our heroes to the brink. With Aya and River down at the end of combat, Xan and Carric rushed to their aid. River decides he'd like to investigate the floating orb and gets a touch to close getting zapped by his close proximity. Xan attempts to look into the orb as well but he's unable to put a finger on it. He does however remember reading long ago about certain stones giving off energy. Bis attempts to get close, but also gets knocked down.

Dorvik vanishes as I get within arms reach. Just me and this orb in pure darkness. Hand stops 6 in front of it. Standing in vast nothingness. He reaches out to the orb and can feel it's warmth. Pausing to see if it reacts to me coming closer. I can feel it's warmth. I complete moving toward it and make contact. I begin to see images in my mind, seeing a war, devils vs angels, devils beating angels until i see an angel beating on an object, banging on it with an hammer on an anvil, this sphere's creation. Soon as the angel touches it, he bursts with energy and vigor. Wearing it as a necklace, the angel lays waste to their enemies while wearing this orb around his neck.

As Dorvik comes back, he explains everything to his companions. Looking around, the trees and everything begins to vanish. River recognizes all of his surroundings, realizing he is close to his very own home. River invites the group to rest at a spot that he is very aware of. The group decides to follow River back to a known camping spot. He's hunted this area before. We can see the shoreline and a bit of a clearing. Find a small shanty that's empty. River points out the boat overturned and comments that anyone can sleep there. Carric immediately heads that way. River starts a camp fire and begins cooking while Xan begins making tea. Dorvik is sitting there, paying full attention to the orb. Looking all over it. Studying it's every inch. Attempting to call out to it with his mind and even whispering to it, "just tell me what you need me to do". River steps away to communicate with his deity, to ask for help about it. He feels a breeze blow in the direction of the orb/Dorvik. As we're sitting there, the light begins to leave the orb and begins to move up his arm. Beginning to shed onto Dorvik, the orb shrinks to the size of a 1 inch marble [[Sphere of Unlocked Power]]. 

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 5
#### Date Start: Evening
#### Date End: April 20th - late afternoon / early evening
The group begins the evening chatting around the fire. Xan asking about his experience again, to which Dorvik is happy to talk about. Explaining in greater detail about the war and fighting between the Angels and Demons. The hammering of the orb, and the Angel laying waste to their enemies. Dorvik finishes his story and decides it's time to get rest. Aya takes note that the moon is now in a 3 quarter phase. The rest of the group decide to turn in for the evening as well. Dorvik wakes up in the night feeling the warmth of the orb. Wakes up but nothing seems to be happening but rest by all the companions. Takes a look around and goes back to sleep. Bisreigh dreams of [[New Geghyar]] and gets enraged by the thought of the town being destroyed. Goes into a fury and rages out while sleep. *LONG REST* 

Everyone wakes up. Xan was up first doing his normal morning ritual, ready to give out cups of tea. Dorvik, Aya, and River all accept the tea. In the meantime, Bisreigh goes searching for Carric. Tries to wake him in the boat only find that he's gone into the water. She tries to get his attention, only for him to come back as she heads back to shore. 

Bisreigh and Dorvik have a great morning conversation getting a bit of personal details about themselves mixed in.

The group starts heading back to [[New Geghyar]], Bis brings her familiar out and is able to conjure a brown bear and begins riding that. 

Upon reaching town, the group is greeted by the gnomes running out, headed by her mom, who greets her in frustration and anger asking where she's been

Dorvik asks what the date is, only to find out it's been 3 weeks and is now the 20th of Apr. 

[[Ierkash]] approached the group... no longer missing a limb. He appears to have had a spear of some sort fashioned to his arm. He informed us that they were about to send a search party.  Tells us we need to speak, but in private. We make our way to the tavern and get a table, and he asks us to explain what happened.  He states that he spoke with Velneland about it, but that's all so far. He ends up tossing a small coin purse to Bisreigh with 15 PP, and thanks her for helping get some revenge for him and her future travels. He hands the group 3 PP for their trouble.

Dorvik received 85 GP for the wine and cart

River and Xan discuss sharing spell books

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 6
#### Date Start: April 20th - late afternoon / early evening
#### Date End: April 21st - noon
Discussing their future together the group seems to find themselves all looking at heading to [[Gilcra]]. The group worked out the details and has decided to stay an evening in [[Bitrashire]], then get started in the morning. Bis and Carric head to Bisreigh's mother's house for the evening. Aya decided to do some work at the brothel to help the group come up with the funds for some diamonds. Dorvik catches Aya off to the side, gives her 100GP and tells her that it's to help procure the diamond's she's looking for. Dorvik decides to take in the night scene around the town and wonders. Xan and River are left at the Tavern, chatting about magic and their past. Xan takes closer looks at River's garb, looking for anything arcane in nature. He's able to make out a specific symbol on his right arm that catches his attention. The conversation continues and they just chit chat the remainder of the night in the tavern. Bis and Carric arrive at her mother's house, and walk into the house to the smell of her favorite food (fish monger's pie). 6 dinner plates set around the table, her mother asks if Carric and Aya will be joining them for dinner. Her mother questions her about her last few days and her most recent adventure. Bis reviews the adventure and catches her mother up on all the latest. Before leaving her mothers house, she gives Bis a 20GP coin pouch.

Dorvik River Bis all end up meandering to [[The Devils Brothel]], owned by [[Violet]],  in a show of support to Aya. Xan escorts River to the door of the brothel and heads back to the tavern to turn into his room. Before heading back, one of the dancers addresses Xan and he thanks her in infernal, her own native language. He catches her off guard and she attempts to keep him in the building. He blushes and quickly escapes as Dorvik and Bis enter the building. [[Sapphire]] approaches to begin chatting up the group and introduces herself. River introduces the group, even Carric who was not actually there. Pointed to just and empty chair with a light blue coat on it. Aya's show begins and she rocks the place. She's completely in control of the show, lights moving and flickering with her. While she's dancing, she begins to stumble enough that Dorvik catches sight and is able to help her by bringing up a massive bed of roses that she falls into and covers up the mistake. The show continues with the crowd into it, as she begins to finish the show, River assists with the end of the show by making some of candles go off with burst of fire. The crowd begins to throw coin purses now rather than just random coins. Aya heads back stage after collecting her money, she managed to pull in 280GP. Violet visits Aya in the back questioning the flowers and fire, but Aya keeps her secret and does not disclose the assist by Dorvik and River. Violet, decides to offer Aya a trade of whatever is in the purse for the 300GP worth of diamonds (a single diamond). At some point in the night River disappears from the table and the group losses track. As the next dancer finishes up their dance, everyone notices that River is now walking out on the stage. Lady Violet looks around confused, all of her girls look back like they don't know. River begins dancing without music and lighting since nothing was planned for his performance. Bis and Dorvik run to the stage to help him down, as they approach the stage, Bis takes the full brunt of the vomit that spews from River. Bis leaves the brothel as Dorvik collects River. Dorvik pays Violet 5GP for the trouble and 3GP for the previous dancer then heads back to the Tavern to drop River and himself in their own rooms. On their way out, Aya douses Bis with water by creating water, and then dries her off and warms her up with fire. Carrying River, Dorvik makes it back to the tavern, assisted by Aya, River makes it to his room and in bed. Bis makes her way back to her mothers house and the group calls an end to the night.

The sun rises, River wakes up fresh and without a hangover. Xan ends up finding Aya sleeping in the open and takes note that she's okay. Bis and Carric wake up to Bis' mother making breakfast, attempting to avoid telling Bis goodbye. River decides to purchase a riding horse for 75GP and Bis looks for some tarps/tents to take on the journey. Bis tosses her ball and her big brown bear, Chewie, makes it's appearance again. She mounts Chewie next to Death, River's new horse, and the group begins heading in the direction of [[Gilcra]]. 

After about 2 hours of traveling, the groups crest a hill and hears a voice say "they're mine, give it back". A goblin and human seem to be fighting over a coin purse. The right leg of the goblin, from the knee down is exposed bone. Dorvik asks the goblin how much is in the pouch, clearly if it's his money, he would know how much was there. The goblin claims 13SP and 1GP, which is what Dorvik counted. Dorvik turns to the old man and asks what's going on, it is very obviously the gobin's money. With that, he drops his mask of many faces and starts running. Carric and Aya chase him down and bring him back. He claims he's just hungry and trying to eat. Xan offers him tea and bread, he very eagerly grabs it and scarfs it down. He begins to walk away, asking if we are all good. Dorvik motions to shake his hand and gives him 10SP, telling him to get some food and find another way to find money. The group finds out his name is [[Benji]] and he is from Gilcra - tells the group of a festival taking place in Gilcra starting in 2 days to welcome the spring. With that, he claims he will not steal again, and heads away from the group in the direction of Bitrashire. We ask the goblin what his name is, he informs the group that everyone just calls him [[Pale]], because of his leg. River offers to allow him to ride with him on his horse toward Gilcra. 

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 7
#### Date Start: April 21st - noon
#### Date End: April 21st - 8pm
//Correction to the end of the last session. Dorvik tells Benji of Catherine and her tavern. Should he really be looking for work and steady income, seek her out and mention his name.//
The group is still traveling to Gilcra, Pale riding on the horse with River, Bis and Carric are riding Chewie, Aya Dorvik and Xan are traveling by foot. Xan asks Dorvik about his history selling wine, which Dorvik explains his brief time as a wine salesman... his time in university, then leaving university and working with his father. That didn't work out either, so he left. And ended up buying wine off a random man in a tavern when he thought he could do well himself. As they're traveling Aya picks up on a whiff and feeling of something... rotted meat? A lingering scent and slight vibrations in the ground. Aya stops abruptly as the rest of the group doesn't notice and continues on. Aya stops the group and lets them know somethings dead around them... but isn't aware of much else. Xan communicates telepathically with Fion, lets him know that there is death about... he sees to the left and right, shorter brush and limbs moving about the brush, a large dog. As the information is coming from his friends, Dorvik dives into the bushes and hides. Pale squeezes onto river, obviously scared of the "rotting meat" smell, "we need to run, as fast as we can... WE NEED TO RUUUUUUUN". River casts mage armor on Pale and tries to cool him. Dorvik feels the vibrations and can tell that it's coming right from behind him. A worg climbs a rock directly in front of us... with what appears to be a hobgoblin on it's back. Multiple begin to appear all around, the group completely surrounded. The head hobgoblins ask Pale what he brought them today... Pale replies... I didn't bring you anything. He demands that they leave their money on the ground and they can then go on their way. Pale informs River... that's [[Mokvel]], just give him your money... he'll let you go. River steps up, tells the leader he's not getting his money... and casts Raulothim's Psychic Lance [[20220511_03]]

At the end of battle, River casts Cure Wounds on Bis to help with her wounds. While fighting, Dorvik was able to tie up one of the goblins. River demands a new horse of Pale, but he only got a look of confusion back. Dorvik wakes the goblin up with a smack. Tells the goblin he has some talking to do. Aya summons a bit of flame and threatens the goblin, Xan offers tea. The goblin objects. Aya pulls the goblin closer and makes the flame even more obvious. Xan begins a line of questioning... looking for info on his boss. Learns that the crew has about 6 to 2 dozen in their crew. Bisreigh demands that we shake him down for the coins in his pockets. Xan unties the goblin and demands he stop on his current plot in life. The goblin begins to run away as Pale takes a shot to finish him off with his crossbow.  Aya talks to him, asks if he knows him. He claims he did, and also states that he knows where they're at. Aya pats down the remaining bodies, comes up with 22GP total. Group decides Aya should keep it to go toward diamonds. Aya uses Cure Wounds on Dorvik for a total of 13HP. Bisreigh decides to attempt to recall her bear, but as the magic ball hits the ground, she is disappointed to see that only a rat has appeared. The group gets on the road and is able to find a decent spot to camp for the evening.

*END OF SESSION*

end of long rest.. roll 2d10

### Session 8
#### Date Start: April 21st - 8pm
#### Date End: April 22nd - 2pm
As the group is set up for the evening, a light drizzle begins to settle in. Much of the sky is clouded and a cool fog has begun to creep across the land. River creates a bonfire for the evening. Bisreigh offers to take first watch, while the rest of the crew begins to buckle down for the evening. River creates an alarm in the direction of the road in an attempt to help catch anything that may be attempting to sneak upon us. Bis sits down, while on watch, with her tinkerer's tools in an attempt to modify her belt... which she is able to do so successfully. Bisreigh asks River about the camp we stayed at the before and really just enjoyed some general chitchat. River references his skull and states he's never really truly alone. River tells Bisreigh about his friend [[Taki]], who appears to be his "spiritual bound" guide of sorts. River and Bis keep watch for two hours before River wakes Dorvik and Bis gets Aya's attention. Dorvik gets the attention of Bis' rat and offers a warm place for it to snuggle and get pets. Aya and Dorvik get pretty deep in their conversation with each other. Asking general questions about their history, where they came from, and what they think is going on. Aya begins asking about Dorvik's family, to which Dorvik does give a reply, but gets uneasy and decides to leave the conversation, telling Aya he's going to patrol and check around the camp. Aya checks on Pale, and not much else going on. Dorvik approaches and wakes Xan to take over his shift, while Aya wakes Carric. Xan gets himself into a comfortable position, calls Fion down, and gives him a few biscuits. Asks that his eyes be his own, and sends Fion out in a circular position around the camp. Because of the night and clouds, Fion can't see much. Xan and Carric enjoy conversation during their watch. Carric talks about Bis' history and about two Dragonborn that took over her village up in the mountains. Putting them into servitude. Lost a good number of her family, and to this day Carric is still looking for them. Xan asks Carric about his history, to which he proclaims that he is a good pirate, and doesn't do any of that nasty pirate business. Carric shows Xan his small sandpiper, to which Xan offers a small biscuit. Carric and Xan talk about their experiences from the past and things that they've gotten into. Carric begins dozing off, however, his sandpiper won't let him. Xan begins reading a book while Fion begins to snooze. Carric does notice while taking a sip of his drink, that he, very specifically, is being watched. Looking over, he sees the silhouette of a baseball-sized orb dripping in the rain. Then disappears. Carric asks Xan if he saw that too, Xan looks over but doesn't see a thing. Xan cast detects magic as a ritual and begins looking around with his sword drawn, as normal as Xan can. He asks Fion to begin circling the camp while going through his normal morning rituals. Pale wakes and asks about the blanket Aya put on him, but Carric is unsure. Pale leans into Carric and says very softly so only Carric can hear, "I saw it". He is unsure of what it is. Carric asks Pale to come with him to see if they can catch a trail. Neither Pale nor Carric are able to find any sign of whatever it was.  The group wakes up for the morning.
#### Long Rest + Fury Roll +15

Pale begins cooking some sort of breakfast. Aya asks what's for breakfast catching him off guard. Xan has some side banter with Dorvik, commenting on his lack of morning workout. The group eats breakfast and breaks down camp to begin finishing their walk to Gilcra. As the group gets closer to the road, they see the tops of very tall buildings, getting their first glimpse of Gilcra. The view to Aya seems familiar but is visibly twitchy, not sure if it's good or not. Xan asks if she's been here before. She says not much closer. Aya seems to be in a bit of a panic. The group continues traveling for about 3.5 hours before really begin seeing more people coming and going from the city. As the group is getting closer to the city, there is definitely a back up to get into the city. The city guard seems to be checking everyone that enters the city. Guards seem to be collecting an entry tax to enter the city, asking folks what they're doing about the town. Dorvik and Bis compete to pay the guard first, but Bis beats him to it. River asks the city guard about a "library" for him and Xan. The guards begin pushing the group through while River tosses him silver for helping him find his way to the library. Bis mentions that maybe it's a good time to visit the [[Crooked Bulette Brewery]], a tavern favorite of Carric's. The group begins heading that way, grabbing food along the way from street vendors. Xan whispers a bit to his familiar Fion, and the bird takes off and flies off into the distance. Bis takes the group to meet with an acquaintance along the way, they approach a massive house and enter right in. They can feel the enchantments surrounding the house. They end up in a room with a very old man, who greets the group. Taking notice of Bis and Carric. From the back, a 6 inch tall suit of armor comes running into the room. From all visuals, he is very much a knight, just of small stature with a purple feather waving about on top of his head. The old man introduces himself as [[Bertram Kinley]]. Bertram is accompanied with and introduces [[Sir Ticks]], a very loud and talkative suit of armor. Dorvik flicks a single copper piece into his helmet as he seems to be looking for "food". Bis speaks up and says that we have something for him to look at. He takes his time and doesn't see anything special. Just a little rock. He makes all sorts of attempts to identify what this item is, but he's not coming up with anything. Bis asks about another bag of tricks to match the one she has. Sir Tick does have a tan bag to sell. It's a bit more expensive that she can afford and asks about potential extra work. Kinley mentions a friend in need but things the group might not be quite up for it. He does offer 15000 GP for completion (surefire proof that they won't be bothered again may bring a bonus sum). Xan does speak up and mention perhaps we should discuss this as a group and asks about a local tavern. Kinley mentions [[Igrids Rest]], just outside and down the street. After asking the group what we are really doing here and if we need to be part of this, even questioning Kinley, Dorvik asks what we're all doing. Kinley doesn't seem to be able to identify the orb around Dorvik's neck. Kinley speaks up and says now wait a minute and speaks that there may be one more thing he can do. Advises the group to step back and begins casting a very high level spell on the orb. A big bang occurs, he's visibly out of breath. Pushes the cauldron toward Dorvik, and he puts it back on his neck. He states that this is an item beyond compare and is fully aware of everything about the item. Kinley mentions that this was created by a god, to which Xan asks where they might learn about it. Kinley mentions [[Raul Rathenal]], human late 60's jet black hair, brown hair, long purple robs with gold trim. Head scholar at the Gilcra Library. Before Kinlay takes her rest, Aya asks if he can identify. Agitated he states he does not know of the item but maybe he jeweler will recognize it. Sir Ticks says he's never seen this sort of excitement from Kinley before. The group talks about the orb and decides to talk about everything over lunch.

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 9
#### Date Start: April 22nd - 2pm
#### Date End: April 22nd - 8 pm
We start the afternoon leaving Kinley's. Xan checks on Fion and gets confirmation of something between the two of them. The group begins heading to the tavern to grab something to eat. While traveling, they discuss their activities and what we can do moving forward. Carric asks Pale if he'd like to find something to do in the meantime, looking for work. They sneak away from the party. They discussed Bertram's potential quest and maybe where/when/how they can potentially take it on. The group makes it to [[Igrids Rest]] and meets [[Igrid]]. She asks if anyone wants to try her own homemade honey mead, to which Dorvik takes her up on it. It has an initial sour taste which almost immediately turns sweet because of the honey. Dorvik compliments her on the drink and says he'll take another, but because of his strength, only gets one more. Sitting at the table, Xan asks for a glass of wine and states that the orb itself makes him a bit nervous but that he is intrigued by it. The group decides that they do need to hit the library to see what they can dig up on the orb. Xan and River discuss going to the library to work out some spells and share trade secrets. 

Carric and Pale are heading toward the docks, Pale is definitely nervous. While walking, Pale sees another Goblin walking around in plain daylight, which makes him feel quite a bit better. While walking with Pale, Carric catches sight, leaning up against a wall, someone taking notes. They glimpse each other for a moment, locking eyes, but the person has a scarlet scarf wrapped around their face. The person is short, possible a gnome/goblin. They are definitely facing Carric's direction, writing... and pauses. They then walk away into the alley beside them. Carric does recognize the garb, the scarf in particular, as someone that works for the [[Scarlet Blades]]. Carric asks just what sort of skill set Pale has, to which he replies with rogue/sneaky. He replies okay, be cool and follow me. Carric attempts to follow the person he saw but ends up at a dead end. Carric says they aren't meant to find it yet and begins heading toward the tavern again. Pale speaks up and asks if he can help with the search. Pale looks around, but he's not finding anything that stands out either. Again they decide to just head to the tavern instead. Pale ends up sneaking a coin purse from a passer-by, and chuckles to let Carric know. The [[Crooked Bulette Brewery]] is noisy and crowded. The two enter without being noticed. The place is completely packed and seems to be standing room only. [[Mrs York]] comes by very busy, without noticing Carric, asks what they want. She completely misses who she's talking to at first but upon asking for rum, she catches sight of who he is. Carric introduces Pale, stating he's looking for work. Carric explains he and Bis have met up with a new adventuring group. She states she'll have to catch up later, but that she is too busy to chat. Pale offers to help with the tavern. Mrs York says she could use the help and Pale gets going. Leans in and shakes Carrics hand and gets to work. 

Bis states she needs to go to the blacksmith. River Xan Dorvik and Aya head to the library. 

Bis approaches [[Shava]] at her smithy. Upon seeing Bis approaching, she sets her hammer down by the anvil. The two of them catch up and have just regular chit-chat. Bis brings up the fact that she's looking for work/money. She does mention she has Misium, she could sell her. Shava is quite surprised as it's quite a rare material. Bis did end up selling the Misium for 300 PP. 

The rest of the group makes their way to the library and enters the giant building. Spiral staircases on either side. They make out that there is a librarian / front desk about 50 ft in front of them. River and Aya approach. River speaks up to the librarian seeking information about spell books and copying spells. But she states that they don't normally "lend" spellbooks. He then asks about the story of angels and demons fighting... Dorvik speaks up and asks if they have any books that tell the story of a legendary battle. She doesn't recall anything, so they ask if Mr Rathenal is available to discuss this. The librarian calls for him and states he'll be around soon. Aya speaks up looking for public records of people that may have been publicly executed and trial/verdicts. Aya begins searching for something, but we don't know what. We don't know what happened but she is very happy and celebrating. Shortly after, an older gentleman comes about and asks if we are the ones asking for him. Dorvik tells the tale as if he was repeating a legend told by his grandfather. Sounding so vivid that it had to be real. Mr Rathenal states that there is an ancient text locked in the basement. Somewhere in the text, is the tale of how tieflings may have come about. There are tales of black magics involved with the book which leads to it being locked away. He states that we aren't worthy of getting access to this book, but that [[King Alvon Uvetia]] holds meetings once a week, and responds to requests, he might be willing to grant access. He allows his people to meet with him on Sundays. Rathenal states the orb is of immense power with the ability to create a great strength in a person or destroy a phylactery. Dorvik and River sense a bit of nervousness in Rathenal for asking about this book. As River begins to ask some additional questions about the book, Dorvik speaks up and simply says "Sphere of Unlocked Power". Rathenal slowly asks where I heard of this from. Without telling, Rathenal simply says good day sir, Dorvik decides that there's nothing here for them. Xan had dismissed himself and reappeared back to the group in much more fancy garb. Wearing a red robe and claiming to go to buy tea. 

Aya leaves with Xan, heading out for his tea errand. They approach Xan's destination. The glass door front reads [[Ninim's Teas]], no one is visible inside beside an elvan woman with her back to the door. Xan calls out, and she responds in elvish "son" as she reaches out for a hug/embrace. Xan is attempting to hold back the tears in front of Aya. They chat and catch up for a bit before Ninith sets a table for dinner, but not before presenting Xan with his favorite tea. Xan has not seen/written/talked to/or been in any contact with his Ninith for some time and this is the first contact they've had. Lots of pleasantries and conversation has taken place. Ninith is having a wonderful evening just knowing Xan is safe and there. 

In the distance, the whole group, regardless of where they are, begins to hear muffled explosions in the background. Xan and Aya move to the window looking out the window. Xan steps out of the door and sees the castle being "pelted" by something in the sky. Potentially fire bolt spell rapid fire casting them at the keep and around the city. Xan tells Ninith to find a safe place and calls to Aya that something is going on. Dorvik River Bis and Carric step out of the tavern to get a better view of what's going on. Bis throws out her bag and a lion shows up, her and Carric get on the lion. The group approaches the castle gates, trying to get a closer view of the creature ~300 ft. The group comes back together while trying to get a better view. Peeper gets withing 100-200 ft from the figure, completely black garb. The face is hidden with two red hands. Each hand has 6 fingers. His attention turns to Mr Peepers, who takes a fire bolt and is destroyed. Before Mr Peepers disappeared, he catches a glimpse of two orange eyes and horns on the front of his head. What appears to be a tiefling. Xan sends Fion about 200 ft away before Fion is destroyed by another fire bolt. 

The figure calls out "I'M HERE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW, YOU ARE NO LONGER SAFE IN YOUR HOMES... GILCRA WILL FALL. THERE IS NOTHING ANY OF YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME OR MY LORD... GILCRA... WILL... FALL! IT WILL BE RAISED IN HELLFIRE TO THE GROUND! BROUGHT BACK TO WHAT IT ONCE WAS!" His hands raise to the air over his head and put his hands together. A ball of black and red begins to form above his head that grows in size. 

Dorvik shots a banishing shot, however as it gets close, it is magically deflected. River Xan Aya Carric and the town guard are all launching magic attacks at him... however nothing is getting through. 

"NOTHING YOU DO CAN STOP ME OR MY LORD [[Edgiac]]" The black orb that he hurled at the castle destroys everything in an 150 ft radius. The whole group is knocked to the floor. 

"EVERYTHING WILL BURN, NOTHING IS SACRED" - as he blinks out of existence

Dorvik begins to feel ... "go east"

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 10
#### Date Start: April 22nd - 8 pm
#### Date End: April 23rd - 10 am
As the dust settles, screams cry out and the area is completely decimated. The damage across was almost cookie cutter in a circular pattern around the explosion. The group hears people cry out from all directions. We know someone or some people were on the castle stairs, but we don't see anyone there now. Dorvik and Xan begin triage the situation. Aya runs to our team mates and ensures everyone is okay. She casts aura of life, anyone within 30ft of her, begins to regain consciousness. We begin to notice that all of us are actually hurt. Pretty well cut up from shrapnel flying all over. Everyone has taken half life damage. 
Everyone makes a con save - Aya - 15; Bis - 8; Carric - 7; Dorvik - 20; River - 10; Xan - 18; <16 fails the sav; those that fail roll a d4; Carric - 3 (right arm broken); Aya - 4 (right leg broken); River - 1 (left arm broken); Bis -3 (right arm broken);
Aya was able to heal a good bit of everyone's damage including several broken bones. Xan looks around (perception roll) and sees furniture/rugs/etc in the castle. He notices that a good bit of the ground itself was destroyed as well, noticing about 6 floors worth of destruction. One of the keep's towers is laying beside the castle destroyed. He notices a female elf, with very long black hair, a ponytail, and dressed in mint green robs with red roses. He notices that she's looking at him, then turns and goes on about whatever it was she was doing.
The group is able to triage and save a good number of people, casting healing spells, using medical knowledge, and getting injured to safety. Xan notices the same elf moving through the town and calls out to them. 
Carric and Bis recognize the elf as [[Myrden Caiwen]]. She has a brief pleasantry with the two of them, and requests an audience with King Alvon Uvetia.
The group is escorted through a side entrance to the castle, one of the few doors still standing. Eventually lead to the King himself. Standing next to the King, is a dwarf wearing brown clothing, no armor, chestnut hair parted to the left, with brown eyes. A very grizzled man, 2-3 feet from the King, leaning on a double sided battleaxe. [[Brottor Rackan]] - Captain of the Gilcra Guard / Bodyguard to the king him. The room is definitely tense. Brottor speaks up and addresses the group to understand what we saw. Xan speaks of a tiefling with six fingers and six horns. Caiwen responds of the emblem worn by their members, to which Dorvik picks up as having knowledge of that same emblem. Carric and Bis know of [[Edgiac]], but at another time he was with another dragonborn, [[Mozu]]. Caiwen questions Bis about the misium, and why it had never been mentioned as having been mined before in her town. Caiwen mentions the run in at the library and why we were asking about the book and how all of this could have happened. Caiwen explains the orb and it's object of ancient power. It has been used to stop a very powerful being from wrecking havoc, possibly a litch... the item is one of a set, but they are unsure of how many were created. It was created however to destroy "the being". There is an alter somewhere in this world that the orbs need to be placed on, with a said being. It seems [[Edgiac]] has the idea of bringing this being back. The King then asks the group to help seek out the remaining orbs, to gather them up and either bring them back or find this alter on our own to destroy. Xan requests access to the book that's under lock and key, to which Caiwen grants the request so long as she is around. The groups asks to discuss it and come back with an answer. Xan mentions the need for resources and then states that he'd like to check on his mother. Aya goes with him while the rest of the group heads back to [[Igrids Rest]] for the night. Xan and Aya are seeing ruble for a bit, but as they further away, the damage sort of tapers out and isn't as bad. His mother's shop is unscathed and completely fine but the door is locked. Xan knocks on the door to check on his mother. She greets them and makes tea. They visit for a short period and they return to [[Igrids Rest]] with the rest of the group. The group discusses things to request from the King for this undertaking. River pays for the evening, drinks, food, and rooms. Before heading to bed, he casts find familiar to bring Fion back to the land of the living.
#### Long Rest - Fury roll +20

Around 8 am, an official towns guard arrives to the tavern to escort the group back to the castle. The group finds Carric still at the bar, and buys him another drink to get him started. Aya questions Carric about Pale. Carric assures the group that he'll be fine and not to worry about him. No guards are with the King this time, just his left and right hands. The group enters and sits down with him. He greats them and welcomes them to the table. Xan speaks up and lets the King know that we are willing to step up and do as the King wishes. Xan did happen to cast prestidigitation on Carric prior to entering. The group makes their requests for good for their quest. Bag of Holdings, Healing Potions, Rations, access to the armory, some gold for our travels, some horses for transportation, potentially some way to communicate with Lady Caiwen. Bis asked for maybe for some pass on taxes, to which the King speaks up that he will provide a letter to provide a discount at shops. Lady Caiwen asks the group to follow and leads them to the armory for everyone to take a piece that's to their taste.

### Session 11 - 20220608
#### Date Start: April 23rd - 10 am
#### Date End: April 23rd - 2 pm
The group finishes up in the armory and is escorted out. As they exit they notice the great doors slamming shut behind them. Aya and Bis notice, sticking out of some rubble, a suit of armor leg which draws their attention. They begin moving some rock, while [[Myrden Caiwen]] approaches asking what they've come across. Upon clearing the rubble, a suit appears out of dirt and reveals a full suit of plate mail. With what appears to be a potbelly stove in the abdomen, it becomes fairly apparent that there is actually a person in the suit. They appear to be exhaust pipes coming out of the back of his shoulders. The head appears to be a standard suit of armor, however, one of the eyes has a monocle. [[Myrden Caiwen]] reaches down to grab the handle on the front of the armor out of curiosity. It seems to have charred bits of spent wood or fuel in the belly. River casts a bonfire in his belly, the flames becoming a vacuuming sucking the flame into the body. The suit begins coming to life, spitting out lines of different systems coming online. The system seems to come online fully. For what appears to be instructions. The suit announces that its directive is to defend, and the system stands. On the chest is written [[MA-TCHES 5H137D]]. When asked who created him, he recalled that he does not remember and that his memory core was corrupted. He repeats that his primary directive is to defend. [[Myrden Caiwen]] seems to think that this is ancient technology lost a long long time ago. Made as weapons of war in ancient times, in times of lost magic. [[Myrden Caiwen]] informs the group that this unit was probably built approximately 2000 years ago. The group makes their way out of the castle and Matches informs them that he recalls the word "MISIUM". Walking through the town is drawing a lot of attention. The entirety of town stops to take in the sight of Matches walking by. Carric catches up just before we get to [[Bertram Kinley]]'s place. Scaring half the group by his sudden appearance. The group enters Kinley's, Sir Ticks is hollering about, asking "well", but he's nowhere to be seen. We hear the tic tic tic's of his small feet clacking on the ground as he approaches. He flips out seeing Matches and calls out to [[Bertram Kinley]], to take a look... who is completely enamored with the sight of Matches.
The group starts shopping while at Kinley's. Xan is able to pick up some spells while Bis browses the available weapons, particularly the 1h swords and axes. Aya finds a dagger that she takes a particular interest in and decides to pick it up. Bis ends up buying a long sword as well as a tan bag of tricks. Carric finds a ring of key extension that he purchases from [[Bertram Kinley]]. 
After everyone finished up their purchases, Xan describes the sphere that he saw the 6 finger tiefling use and asks if he knows of such a spell. [[Bertram Kinley]] states he has but that he doesn't really have any additional information about it exactly. Aya speaks up looking for apothecary-type ingredients. 
The group travels back to Ingred's Rest and introduces Matches to Ingred. Ingred wants to see how he fuels himself up and watches as he sticks a new log into the potbelly chest piece. The horses arrive at the Ingred's Rest, and River jumps with excitement to view the new animals. He and Bis give the horses plenty of pats and welcomes them to the group. The back of the cart includes a dozen planks of wood as requested by Aya. Xan removes himself from the group and retires to the room attempting to copy spells. Matches ask for a sturdy workbench and are pointed in the direction of Shava's blacksmith. Bis tags along to introduce Matches to her. Matches pull out a screwdriver from a compartment in his arm to begin performing repairs on himself. Bis throws one of her balls from her back of tricks and a black bear is summoned to him. Aya builds a hay trough on the side of the wagon that was delivered as well as foot pegs for easier access. They painted the wagon several shades of green. River helped Aya put the wagon together and the group calls it a day. 
//Long Rest 

The group wakes, has breakfast, coffee, teas, etc. River and Dorvik are both sitting in the front of the wagon. Bis throws another one of her magic balls and manages to pull a tiger, which she is now riding on. Aya decides to shed her clothes and run ahead of the group. They are now officially on their way east, heading away from Gilcra. As Aya gets far enough away from the group, she waits for the group to arrive. While she's sprinting forward, Fion takes off and matches her speed, a small competition breaks out, and the two race. Although Aya can't match Fion's speed. As the group gets further away from Gilcra, they begin to get more and more into a wooded area. While riding, they hear a scream and a young girl, about 14 years old, comes running out of the woods. "SOMEBODY HELP ME, THEY'RE CHASING ME DOWN, THE WILD DOGS". The group hears multiple worgs running and hollering through the woods.

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 12 - 20220616
#### Date Start: April 23rd - 2 pm
#### Date End: April 23rd - 6 pm
#### Story Teller: Xan (Jay)
The group identifies the young girl running out of the woods... Dorvik immediately jumps off the cart and yells out to River "I hope this is the one that got away!". River stopped the cart and climbed to the top. Aya changes direction and is making straight for her. The girl has red stains on her clothes which resemble what could be blood? also might be jam? Arrows soar out of the woods and strike the little girl down. Dorvik notches his bow and readies an arrow. [[MA-TCHES 5H137D]] climbs off the cart and begins walking in that direction. Aya makes it to the little girl, can see the arrows lodged into her back. She has no pulse and has passed. The little girl was injured prior to her coming out of the woods and left a bit of a blood trail running through the grass. Upon Xan's investigation of the little girl, he notes that she is pretty clean and doesn't look like someone that has been in the woods for long. Less than a day for sure. Dorvik states as much he wants to give chase, she needs to be taken back to town... her parents need to know. Bis is giving chase on her tiger with Carric and throws another of her mystical balls. It poofs into a baboon and runs with her next to the tiger. Aya Dorvik and Xan stick with the little girl and tend to her body, discussing what to do with her. Aya carries her back to the cart and places her gently in the back of the cart. Aya takes off for the woods, Xan makes a look at Dorvik, shrugs and starts running after as well. Dorvik follows suit and chases behind. Bis and Carric chase into the woods on the back of her tiger. Neither are able to distinguish sight and sound of the worgs they're giving chase to. The do see a bit of blood near the base of tree (unsure if it's fresh or not). The pair come upon a makeshift campsite that has been ripped to shreds. They find a male and female, ripped to shreds. A destroyed cart nearby is completely mangled. They make the assumption that these are the parents of the little girl. The sight is gruesome. Carric determines that both adults were blond, matching the same color of the little girl. Bis is able to uncover some worg tracks heading into the woods off to the north. She also picked up on some drag marks, something was drug for a bit, and then disappear. Dorvik picks up on the tracks of a tiger and continues following them into the woods, eventually coming upon Bis and Carric. Arriving to the scene of an awful situation. [[MA-TCHES 5H137D]] is patrolling around the cart and notices a small speck of a bird flying in the air above the woods, assuming that the bird is actually [[Xan Taramor]] giving chase through the woods. [[Aya]] casts Pipen as a raven to follow. States that she's not letting Bis go on her own. Xan decides to give chase after Aya and Dorvik follows. As the group is following through the woods, they begin to pick up on sounds through the woods. While the whole group hears the noise, [[Aya]] make out a few words... "followed" "coming" "get ready"... the group is able to also pick up on the scent of campfire smoke. We begin to see a wooden structure pieces, stumps sticking out of the group in the distance about 250 ft away. [[Aya]] attempts to get within 60ft of the wooden structure. Dorvik sees her approaching and goes stealth. Fion is able to make out a good bit of the area as the trees have opened up a bit. Fion is able to see a pretty good size structure and make out about 3 enemies, while Xan makes out an additional 2. Xan casts mage armor on himself in preparation for what he thinks is about to come. Aya casts scortching ray at the wooden structure and directly at the gate of the structure. The front gate does take damage but does not catch fire. Behind the walls, sounds of nervous goblins begin to ring out. The sounds of worgs begin scratching around. The entirety of worgs begin howling as a whole pack. [[MA-TCHES 5H137D]]s is able to hear the howling, announces to [[River in the Night]] that he will be moving toward the alerted worgs. [[River in the Night]] decides to stay behind. [[MA-TCHES 5H137D]]s then transforms into "snowmobile form" and begins racing to the noises... encounter 4 officially begins

#### Date End: April 24th - 2 pm
#### Story Teller: Aya (Shawna)
#### Fury +12
River makes the suggestions to take the little girl to her the location they found her parents, to bury them all together. Dorvik stats that he'll help River do that. Aya decides to deal with the goblin as she originally stated, and begins burning the encampment to the ground. Xan helps to assists in burning the village down with Aya. The group gathers in the cart and begins heading down the road for a few hours before pulling of to make camping. While traveling, Dorvik apologies to Xan and Aya for shooting at them. He really didn't know what came over him. While in stasis mode, MA-TCHES is able to act as a sentinel and take watch over night. Bis gives the group a scary story around a campfire, explaining the reason for not liking tea. In fact, she was given a drink with human bits in it and she has refused to drink tea from people pushing tea anymore. River and Carric decide to take first watch. River catches what looks like something invisible in the night. He moves out to investigate but isn't able to pick up any trails. Comes back to Carric and tells him what happen and goes about having a few drinks. River wakes Xan up to switch night watch duties, Carric wakes Aya. Bis' tiger brings a small deer for the group in the morning just before disappearing into the forest. Fion brings a small finch not wanting to shown up and leaves it at Rivers feet. *LONG REST* 
<Sunday the 24th>
River gets up in the morning and looks for tracks that may have been left in the night. Dorvik begins checking the weather for the day and the rest of the group beings packing up to keep on there travels. Bis summoned one of her creatures, pulled an Axebeak. She saddled the Axebeak to be her mount for the day. Bis and Carric get called out in passing on the road, Carric seems to be annoyed by the fact. Bis introduces the group as [[Beak and Tong]]. The pair of traveling salesman begin to show their wares from the back of their cart. Dorvik ends up buying an antitoxin from them. Xan ends up buying a tea of bolstering. River ends up buying some mushrooms. The group buys other misc items from them and River even plays a game of cards to win a Ring of Protection and a Ring of Fire Resistance. They tell them about a circus going on, [[Madam Gartoron's Glorious Ganders]], at the intersection, about 6 hours travel distance. Carric is able to purchase a flask of rum from Beak and Tong. Upon leaving the pair, Aya tells Bis she needs to tell her something. Rides with her and shows a poster of a circus. Showing images of her on the poster "Priestess of the Moon". And hands her a tuff with a locking mechanism that is now open. Aya explains that it is her slave collar. Aya tells her not to trust a thing she says, but she used to be a slave. She knew her as a beast master. Aya reveals herself to be a Lythari, a rare and almost extinct race of elves. Bis shares her experience of not being able to save her father. And says that they are going to get to this person and save whoever they can. The group continues to travel and eventually crests a hill and is able to make out a very small tent far in the distance. As the group approaches, they hear jovial music and many people walking around. Traders, carts, and people are making their way around the crossroads. Stopping to take in the sight. The closer the groups gets to the people and tents, Aya begins to get much much more shaken. Bis picks up on her nervousness and directs the group to go ahead and pull over early. In the distance, Xan notices a tall elf with a few scares on his checks, wearing something floral and inviting clothing. Upon noticing the man, the spilled tea from stopping the cart has passed way out of his mind. Xan appeared to go pale, as he spoke the words Adar. (potentially Xan's father)

Adar.... Xan pauses as he sees what he believes is his father. Takes a few steps forward, pauses and stops dead still, hands drop to his side. Dorvik asks how long it's been. He claims at least a century. Aya explains her history and past with the circus. Explains the situation those held captive live in. Explained the situation Xan's father is probably in. She explains he couldn't have been here for longer than a year. She's been free for that long and she never saw him in her time with the circus. She explains her son [[Lumin]] is here (not biological). River suggests that he and Dorvik visit the circus to take in whatever details we can. Aya stats that we should keep a lookout for those with neck tattoos as they're the guards and mentions the slaves wearing the neck collars. She HIGHLY advises to stay away from the glowy powder. Aya says to ask [[Lumin]], "what the beautiful part about being nothing" is... to which he should "you can become anything"... he would be the only one to know how to answer that. Xan mentions his fathers name is [[Azzan]] and that he was a knight commander. Xan mentions that we could ask him if he likes tea, he should say no. Xan reveals that this is his reason for coming North and that he will not leave without him. Before leaving, Xan asks Fion to circle above while River, Dorvik, and Carric go to scout the circus. He's able to make out the different tents and pick out there uses. Aya states that there used to be more tents. But during her escape, there were fires and explosions and when she was told to run, it was all used as a distraction to leave. Xan pulls out a yet to be seen katana and begins going through his rituals to calm himself. Before heading out, Carric casts masks of many faces to look like his brother. He gets broader, a bit stockier, red hair with a beard. Dorvik leaves his longbow at the wagon. The three approach the circus and hop in like to enter. As we approach, we do come to a man that looks very similar to Xan. Facial features and the way he carries himself can very much be seen in Xan. We get a really strong feeling that this is in fact Xan's father. The gold ring around his neck has very faint ruins etched into it. It doesn't appear to be more than one piece and looks smooth. Dorvik asks if he has a preference of tea inside, he states he doesn't like tea himself, but recommends the jasmine. Rivers mentions that he appears to have more skills than just manning a ticket booth and asks if he'll be performing. He mentions that this was his station and wasn't going to be anywhere else. While walking through the circus proper, we take note of a person sitting with a crystal ball. An albino Tabaxi talking with kids and causing mini fireworks inside the crystal ball. River steps up and sits down in front of him. He gives River a nose boop and instantly knows his name. River is able to see that his eyes have gold ring circles around his iris, indicating he's intoxicated by the glowy powder. Rivers directly comes out with his questions and asks the question Aya suggested. And he responded with a roundabout answer she told them to expect. As we're moving through the circus, we've really only seen 2 guards... Carric pointed out those with neck tattoos. Dorvik suggests they move around the perimeter and then move inside. As we move in, we do pick up on 2 more guards. We move into the main tent area and take in the sight. We take note of the sights around and try to clock the number of guards and performers. As we move around the tent we notice guards at each of the breaks in the bleachers around the room, a total of 5. As the show that was taking place ends, River casts invisibility on the 3. Carric begins making his way out with the crowd. Dorvik sits tight while the crowd clears looking for a way into the cast tunnel. Unable to find any, he moves as close as he can to the tunnel and sits tight. River manages to follow the previous acts footprints into the tunnel and is able to make his way to the tunnel. He continues investigating the space. River and Carric end up running into each other while invisible and decide to start looking for Dorvik. Dorvik is keeping an eye on the tunnel exit to catch the participants and guards, coming and going. Do manage to clock 6 guards gather at the tent exit. He makes his way out and catches Lumin sad and sitting on the floor. He produces a small rose in front of him on the ground and blows a small scent of Aya his way before escaping the tent. Lumin picks up on the sound of the tent dropping behind him as Dorvik sneaks out. Aya catches Xan and asks "what" his father is. Xan simply states that he's his father. She presses and states that the circus doesn't just keep regular beings. She then offers to take his fathers place in the circus since it has been all she's known. It's what she's grown up with. Dorvik shows up at the end of their conversation, Carric and River show up just behind him. River explained everything we saw. The group discusses the events that unfolded at the circus. Aya wants to know if Carric is capable of being an ass... and goes to turn Aya into the circus. Everyone decides it's not a good idea. It seems the group is going to attempt to take Aya as a prisoner to draw out the minotaur. The group works out the details of how they will produce Aya to the circus. The group gathers up and heads to the circus. Dorvik has gone stealthy and approaching the circus from another vantage point while Carric enters through the front door with Aya. The same two that were checking weapons earlier are near the entrance with Azzan when they notice him. He turns too look as they call out to Carric. Xan notices his father as he cocks his head slightly. The golden ring around his iris are fading. Azzan catches a glimpse of Aya and speaks... [[Amisra]]...

#### Date End: April 24th - 5 pm
#### Story Teller: Carric (Joe)
Upon entering the circus, the group sees 8 thugs and Xan's father. Taking note that the iris of Xan's father seems to be loosing that golden circle. Indicating that he may be coming down from the golden pixie dust drug the works use to keep them high. Carric demands to speak with the circus mistress, stating he has something she might want. Carric picks up that Azzan is looking at him with hate in his eyes. They are escorted into the main tent by the guards. While they enter Dorvik makes his way into the tent, via the same path he took before to exit. The mistress presents herself and demands to know who he is as she can beyond his disguise, claiming she talked with [[Delvin]] earlier in the day. Carric lets loose a eldritch blast. It connects and damages the mistress. She laughs and asks if that's the best he's got?! Carric drops the rope runs at the mistress. At that moment, Lumin begins screaming in pain, as it appears something is causing pain. While invisible, Bis has moved herself around to the right around the tent. Xan has been taking in the details of the room, noting the locations of the guards. The Mistress has noticed Bis and Xan through their invisibility by way of their foot prints being left in the sand. Azzan is asked to explain that [[Delvin]] is a murderer, working for the [[Scarlet Blades]]... Azzan asks if Aya is really Amisra's daughter. Azzan tells the story of when he and Amisra fell in love and how they came to be a couple. Spending decades in solitude. While tracking what seemed to be a feral bear, she never returned. And he was unable to locate her, her tracks, and nothing. As if she had vanished. Eventually she returned and all that had happened to her. She told the tale of what had happened. How she was captured and sold. Never saw her sellers face, but heard the name [[Nine Lives Morgan]]. She talked about the baby she gave birth to and her time in the circus held captive. Azzan further explained the time after Amisra and how he was defeated and unable to go on. Aya slow claps, and asks if he's rehearsed that story. She mentions his abandonment of his original family. Further exchanges went back and forth between Aya and her father Azzan. Mistress activates some sort of device which disables all magical items. At that moment, Azzan looks over at Xan and catches his face... then calls out his name XAN! She tells him to move forward and his reaction is to release a fireball. It hit, but it seems to have dissolved into her. Roll for initiative...

*Reached level 9*

### Session 16 - 20220713
#### Date Start: April 24th - 5 pm
#### Date End: April 24th - 8 pm
#### Story Teller: Dorvik (Nate)
During the battle, Aya and Xan were incapacitated... MA-TCHES was able to stabilize Xan, who then cast revivify from his ring to bring Aya who is being held in her father's arms. From the stands [[Lumin]], calls out for Aya, asking if it was here. The golden collars seem to have fallen off from the captives necks. An interaction between Lumin and Aya takes place, culminating in Lumin's passing. Bis is thinking about her brother and Aya seems to have acquired the gift of telepathy from him, as she is now able to read Bis' thoughts. Aya stands up and begins dragging the lifeless minotaur through the circus big top toward the entrance. She exits the tent and begins making a fire stake to begin burning her body on. River steps out to the crowd to begin addressing them. Informing them of there now freedom and release from the circus. Some speak up about their now loss of jobs. Bis speaks up to inform the people of Gilcra and the massive attack they just suffered from. Stating that they would most likely be able to find work there. Aya sets the body ablaze. Azzan, Xan, and Dorvik remain in the tent. Azzan and Xan remain locked in tension. Carric is no where to be seen. River looks around the tent and manages to find a small safe. Xan asks his father... "WHY, it has been 100 years". Azzan discusses the terms of his exile. Azzan takes a step forward while Xan takes a step back. Xan reaches back and pulls out the katana of his father. "This is yours, which was never properly given to me..." sets the sword down, turns around and walks back to his friends and leaves the tent. Dorvik stays in the tent to watch Azzan. Who grabs the sword and is very silently audibly weeping. Azzan approaches Dorvik in the stands, kneels down, lays a hand on Lumin's head. He is visibly shaking/sweating... very physically exhausted. Azzan asks Dorvik to tell Xan he's sorry and he still loves him... they will meet again, taking the sword with him. Disappearing out of the tent. 

The fires and embers have ended... Aya still appears to be on fire above the knee, is a small circular flame around her. She looks around to see what she has done, but looking down is a 2 ft diameter circle around her where the fire never touched. "You shackle me no longer... " as she spits on the remaining bits of what once was there. As she's lost in her thoughts, River attempts to sneak back into the tent with Dorvik. In passing, River asks Xan how it was seeing his father but continues walking into the tent. Aya can't pull herself to look at Xan because she feels very awkward, attempting to move around him. He has a quick exchange to reaffirm his friendship and now his family relation to her. Bis saw Aya's feelings come out has brought out her own feelings for her family. Carric is confronted with the reality of who his brother is and what he does has him very conflicted. Bis reminds Carric that the Mistress was able to speak to him but can't work out how that communication would have taken place in such a short period of time, from when his face was seen walking around to that same evening. Carric and Aya discuss the events and what might end up now taking the groups attention. Upon Azzan walking out Dorvik spent his time tending to the body of Lumin, wrapping the body in silks that could be found around the circus. River joins and helps, assisting to bring the body down out of the stands of the circus. As the sun is going down, Aya is able to make out the silhouette of a figure in the front door. Aya approaches the silhouette. Azzan steps forward and places his hand on her shoulder. States how much she looks like her mother... she can sense how much he is struggling, coming down off of the drugs that the circus has used to control it's people. He apologizes to Aya, tells her he didn't even know she existed. He attempted to find her when he found out, while doing so was captured when his search brought him to the circus. Azzan turns into a white wolf, noting that she is like him. He asks her to go for a run with him... which they do. While away they have a deeper conversation, at the end, Aya takes off her neckless and hands it to Azzan. Azzan grips the neckless and gives it back to her. He turns back into wolf form and they part ways. While they were together, Xan released Fion to find his father, and return upon finding him. While all of that was going on, Bis and Carric would have been looking for information on his brother. River presents a chest to Dorvik, found it in the Mistress' quarters. Dorvik is able to pick the two locks on the chest. 

Once unlocked, Dorvik hands the chest back for River to open.

Items in the Chest
- Crystal Ball (Identify next session)

	- contracts //last one in the stack has the name of [[Delvin]] to hunt Amisra
	- bill of sale //Amisra for $25000 GP

	- Dorvik takes 200GP (Dorvik goes unseen)

Aya returns to the group in the tent, to Lumin's body. Aya wraps a moonflower vine around him. Aya envelops his body in a red fire that turns to a blue color as it consumes his body and sends him on to the afterlife. 

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 17 - 20220720
#### Date Start: April 24th - 8 pm
#### Date End: April 26th - 2 am
#### Story Teller: River (Patrick)
The group asks MA-TCHES to identify a few items. The magnifying glass will give advantage on an investigation check once per day. The second item is a scrying eye. Once per day it will allow you to cast scry. Aya gives MA-TCHES the blood rose that was presented to her when she spilled her blood on the alter in [[Verboten Lush]], whoever's blood was used to make the rose, they can eat it and return to full health. IF anyone other than the creator consumes it, that person/creature takes 10d6 poison damage. The group calls it to get some rest for the evening because of all of the recent events. A goat and MA-TCHES took the first watch shift. Xan, MA-TCHES, and the goat take the second watch shift, not much of anything goes on and the evening passes on. Carric decides to stay up for the 3rd shift with MA-TCHES and the goat. 4th shift is taken by Xan and Aya, still quiet. MA-TCHES decides in the morning to check out the people wondering around the circus, informs them that the circus is no longer around... then turns and walks away. With the rise of the sun the next morning, Dorvik feels the pull of the orb, drawing them to the East. The group spends the full day travelling. Occasional traveler here and there, but about 7 hours into the journey, the group arrives at a mountain pass. At this pass, the direction I begin to feel is beginning to pull North rather than East. The direction does not pull in a way of the road and it seems it's about time to begin heading into the mountains. The group makes an attempt to ride the cart up a cliff and eventually finds a shaded area to find someplace to rest. River and Dorvik decide to go hunting, and Bis' summoned creature (a mastiff / dog) picks up the trail of a mountain goat. Dorvik takes the shot and is able to down the mountain goat with a single shot. Tiny picks up the goat and River blesses it and thanks nature for the meal. The wind blows and we can feel a presence fill the arear through the wind. The group back at the cart, MA-TCHES creates a quick forge to work on and Bis assists with the whole process. The two of them make a quick release system so the horses can be detached quickly from the cart. While seeing everyone else setting to their tasks, Xan begins getting dinner prep'd, and is completely unsure of what to be doing. Lost in the kitchen and really unsure what to be doing. While on night watch, MA-TCHES enters a sort of trance, he starts scanning and notices he is not in the mountains anymore, but on the floor in an elongated hallway. Wooden floor and walls and he notices on the left side of the hallway, a grand mural with seven gemstones each a color of the rainbow, on the opposite side of the hall are candle holders. Within each are candles, burning the same colors as the gemstones, however not lined up across from each other. He doesn't sense anything amiss and MA-TCHES leaves the group to sleep. A dead end wall in one direction, but the hallway in the other direction is blackness... unable to see the end. River wakes up and asks Dorvik if he's feeling anything, a sense of being pulled in a direction. River dives into his knowledge of arcana and feels the walls, feeling that they're real and not magical, but all the magic users can definitely sense magic is here. While concentrating on all of her magic, Aya is able to detect a hidden door just down the hallway. Aya grabs the door handle and before anyone is able to react, in the blink of an eye, the entire group is now in a small round room with a shallow water well with only one way in. The room is only about 20 ft in diameter. The room contains a massive 8 ft tall statue of a knight in full gear with the exception of its right hand which is pointing down. There is a gauntlet in the water below, definitely made of metal/steel. Bis attempts to articulate any of the parts of the statue but nothing about it moves. While discussing the way to best grab the glove, River reaches out and just grabs at it. When he does, the room begins filling with water. River quickly tries to put the gauntlet back but the water continues to rise. River puts the gauntlet onto his hand and it shrinks to his size, the water continues to rise. Xan grabs his hand and shapes it as it was on the statue, pointing down. The water stopped rising and is now draining. Upon that, the group blinks into the next room. Another wooden wall type room, 20x20 room. The ceiling is about 15ft high. Aya is in the corner vomiting on the floor. The gauntlet on Rivers' hand has vanished. The room has 7 different stones, one for each color of the rainbow. They are all to the right of a passage without a door. Xan begins investigating the plaques on the wall... they appear to be seamless to the wall. Xan asks River if he thinks the gems can come off the plaques. He is made aware of some things but the group doesn't know. Bis grabs a stone and begins acting weird as well. Dorvik hears River outbursts to grab a stone so Dorvik grabs blue. The rest of the gang grab stones and are each afflicted with their own issue for the group to figure out. The group manages to figure out everything afflicting the group and is now standing in the room that we are able to walk back out to the hallway. The group sees Carric freeze, and in front of him he sees a golden sphere in front of him. The group does not see this happening. Carric is told he is being tested, and sees the same vision Dorvik got. With that, the group wakes back at camp and it seems as though no time has passed and they never left. *everything flashes, we see the same vision, golden sphere being forged by angels. being used to fight demons. being attached to armor. attached to a gauntlet, holding it into the air and blasts a giant radiant beam of energy... wiping out whatever it touched. The energy toll on the angel was heavy. no facial features stand out. He appears to be in pain. in the distance, we see more demons encroaching on him. his energy returns and he sends off a blast of energy to wipe out the remaining demons.* coming too, Xan asks what we say, to which we repeat the story given to us.

*LONG REST*
The group wakes from a long rest, Tiny (the mastiff) has dissipated with the rising of the sun. The group heads off the mountain, back to the main road, following the pull from the orbs in a southern direction. While riding Xan starts a conversation with MA-TCHES, asking about his ability to forge weapons. Those outside the cart, notice that there is a slight deformation in the earth itself. Those that notice do see some black, shiny, reflective glass... the group notes that Bis is overwhelmed as she relays that we are "home...". The group continues on the road, eventually coming to a small house on the side of the road. In common, "The Lucky Dragon In"... what's weird, in the word dragon, the O and N are scribbled off a bit. The group notices several horses tied up in a little "run in" and it appears the tavern is pretty busy. What's weird about this place is that no people are observed, and it's oddly quiet. Delicious food scent is coming from the tavern. Xan warns that he has a bad feeling about the place, but Aya pushes forward and wants to move on in at the smell of the food. River begins casting telepathic bond with Dorvik. Carric is sitting on his horse watching what's going on, while Bis is looking at what's going on around the horse hitch. Aya opens the front door, instantly the sound of a band and a large crowd envelopes the group. People dancing on tables, dice, card games, all sort of activities taking place. Aya takes a step in, and instantly in front of her a giant goliath appears. Dressed in black and white dress, with a platinum dragon decretive coiling up their body, resting no their shoulder. The place is very clearly a place of gambling and good times. The group spend the whole evening there playing games and drinking the away the evening. Bis ends up winning the evening by winning the grand prize "Pearl of Power". The evening begins to wind down with the group looking for a place to sleep. They've been informed that anyone playing in the tavern stays for free. The group asks Xan to take on the party funds.

Xan makes the group breakfast... tea biscuits with his spiced tea from the south, which gives a quite strong "hot sauce" flavor. Bis and Aya point out the processed deer hanging from a tree. Xan sliced a big hunk of the deer and preps it with the breakfast. Bis remarks that her tastebuds are quite okay with the dry tea rather than wet. The group travels south in the direction Carric and Dorvik state feeling the pull from their orbs. Because of heavy mud from rain the night before, the group is moving at about 3 quarters speed. < travel for the remainder of the day and setup camp for the evening; group has an uneventful evening > Woke up the next morning, Xan insists on continuing to cook. The day of travel is much worse, rain and sloppy roads. While driving, one of the wheels on the cart shatters as it makes solid contact with a rock and rut. Bis works to repair the wheel. Aya takes a dip in the river in an attempt to wash off. Dorvik & River look around for some fish in the river. Fion picks up a slight vision of a house off in the damaged that is partially destroyed. They approach the house and see that the house is badly burned... not by fire though. There is a bridge that looks decayed and the buildings around are fairly in ruins. Xan continues to circle the town with Fion, look through it's eyes. Carric does the same with Peeper. The two scout the town looking for survivors of the town. As the group approaches a bridge, Xan and Carric are able to make out a large silhouette in the river near the bridge. A few bubbles can be seen coming up to the surface. As we are moving across, River is able to calm the horses and able to calm them while going across... Xan picks up on the water beginning to boil as a black dragon ([[Ommas]] - the black dragon, Bis recognizes the dragon) SHOOTS out of the water into the air! [[20220802_06]] ... group is able to down the dragon in great fashion... with Bis making the final blow as she releases her 2nd lvl fury ability

MA-TCHES and River begin heading into the cave
The two of them explore the cave, making their way through. They are required to cross a pool of acid, but still have water walk on them.
MA-TCHES casts detect magic to see if anything pings in his area, mainly looking for something at the bottom of the acid pool

As the group is sitting around for the evening, investigating the loot from the hoard. Xan proceeds to cast 3 spells into his ring... Shield / Featherfall / Mage Armor. The group begins claiming treasure and divides to money accordingly. 
The group is still heading in the southern direction as Dorvik and Carric confirm the pull to the south
To the south lies [[Fort Torvas]]. At this point, about 3 days of travel
Xan suggests the group continue South to Gitelik, mentioning that he did study there... looking as if he didn't intend to give that last bit of information away.
Dorvik names his new bow Din, which translates from Elvish to "Silence"
Dorvik gives River his vial of antitoxin, unaware of how long his own poisoning will last
The group calls it an evening and takes a *LONG REST*
#### Fury +21
Xan is making breakfast again as the group raises... wine with teabags and leftover rations served on top of teabiscuits
Dorvik wakes up feeling relieved of the poison effects from the cave, however River and Carric are still suffering. River decides to use the vial of antitoxin given to him from Dorvik
The group begins their travels heading south. Xan records new recipes and Bis stays in bed attempting to sleep of her exhaustion. She is able to manage another *LONG REST* and removes another level of exhaustion.
After traveling for 8 hours, the cart comes to a halt in an attempt to give the horses a break. The group is surrounded by nothing. 
While taking a short break, Aya goes out hunting for supplies to create an antitoxen for Carric. She is successful and Carric takes it down, clearing up his poison status
Sun has gone down and horses are refusing to move anymore. 
Group feels the temperature begin to drop, a few degrees every 10 minutes or so. 
It's unnaturally cold and the group notes that this is not right
River is beginning to lose control of the horses as they begin to rear and buck while the entire groups sight begins to diminish, dropping to what seems like 3 ft of vision
The group outside of the cart see a light figure approaching in the distance. Bis casts detect magic and is feeling a really strong pull from all of the fog around, then slightly moving to the light source approaching the group
As the light source approaches, the fog is moving and dissipating from the ground up
Dorvik is able to make out 2 massive/huge displacer beasts coming straight toward the group - about 15 ft away
The beasts stop and a skeleton approaches from the beasts, holding a lantern above his head. The skeleton in common says "Why hello there fellow traveler, what brings you here on this jolly day... - [[Tony]]" he introduces the group to his own shop - [[Tony's Scrolls tasteful tinctures treasures and haberdasheries]]

MA-TCHES takes final watch with Chewy; nothing worth noting is picked up
Xan gets up, completes his normal routine and begins cooking breakfast
Aya is searching for a fox den, but the group isn't sure what's going on
She is able to grab a small baby fox and begins casting the awaken spell
Aya appears to have brought Pip "to life"?
Dorvik gives the wrong items to Bis and Xan... Xan got the sack and Bis got the note - the sack contained gold and the note was written in a language that Bis can't read
Bis and Xan review the items left and discover they were given the wrong items, Bis gets herself together and lets everyone know she is going to look for Aya
Around the same time, a firefox with Aya's boot in his mouth comes strutting out of the woods as Aya comes out a bit later
Bis declared that she was starting the "Little Legs Treaty" stating that we will not go exploring without the others causing the group to be left out of battle
Pip strikes up conversations with the group while Aya passes out and attempts to get a long rest in
The group loads up into the cart and begins heading south again, River and Aya are passed out, Dorvik is driving the cart
The group left at 7 am and drove for 8 hrs, so it's about 3 pm, while the group was traveling, Xan was attempting to study another of the spell scrolls
Dorvik picks a random spot to pull off the road and park the cart for a bit
River wakes up and is scared by the Pipen, he attempts to throw him out of the cart but Pipen manages to dart to the side and avoid River
Xan asks MA-TCHES if he's able to help him with some tinkering, to which MA-TCHES states he was going to ask him to help with some smelting
MA-TCHES is able to melt down the silver and asks the group if he's able to upgrade anyone's weapon to make it magical with the silver
Aya states that she would like to have a magical weapon and asks if MA-TCHES would help
MA-TCHES completes the upgrade and is able to give Aya back a silver dagger; used up the 5 silver cutlery
The group decides to go ahead and travel through [[Fort Torvas]], but Aya mentions that she has some concerns and needs to chat with Xan prior to moving into [[Fort Torvas]]
The evening comes to an end and the group settles for a long rest
River and MA-TCHES take first watch; no issues during shift
Bis and Dorvik take second watch with MA-TCHES; nothing happens but we see River sneak off into the woods
River hunts a boar, throws his boomerang and hits, does 7 damage
River begins to get attacked, picked up into the air and dropped, with the appearance of swamp-thing

*END OF SESSION*

### Session 24 - 20220906
#### Date Start: May 1 - 2 am
#### Date End: May 1 - 3 am
#### Story Teller: River (Patrick)
The story opens to River hanging upside down, hanging from vines... surrounded by moss and swamp lands
River seems to recall or recognize the creature as a Vinelord
The Vinelord got tired of the talking and excuses and lies; whipped River into a tree... loudly
Dorvik hears tree branches break and the sound of a loud thud as River makes contact, as well as the sound of the wind leaving Rivers body
In on motion, Dorvik grabs his bow and hops to his feet. Tells MA-TCHES and Bis... "TROUBLE", and take off into the woods heading in the direction of the sound

#### Story Teller: Aya (Shawna)
< missed the first bits of the evening >
Dorvik asked MA-TCHES for some arrows of light, in order to light up a battlefield
Aya told Xan she had some things to do and that she'd be back, but not to worry
*LONG REST* completes the level 10 advancement 
prior to anyone waking up River muddies Xan's tea as his get back for roasting his hunted boar
travelling toward fort torvas
River has been driving poorly, hitting every pot-hole and run off, Dorvik is taking in the sights and warning River of dangerous terrain
River ends up running over a hunters pitfall trap, causing the front axles to dive in, the horses manage to pull them out, but the rear axle completely busts off the cart, essentially dragging the whole rear end of the cart on the ground
River is thrown from the cart, landing to the side, taking 2 points of dmg
Dorvik manages to take a quick reaction and catch the reigns; completely ignored River flying off the cart
The rear of the cart is highly busted with gear and wine scattered and broken in the hole
Some rustling in the bushes was detected, upon noticing, River puts a hand on Dorvik and turns the two of them invisible
3 short gnomes come walking out of the bushes, dressed as bushes themselves, attempting to camoflage themselves
One of them speaks up and states how sorry they are for causing such destruction, they were out hunting and made this trap for a creature they were hunting
Tom Dom and Tiddle, all siblings, set of brothers / triplets
After eating dinner and being treated to a nice meal, the triplets are scared away by River and Dorvik's antics and hearing of the potential for them being eaten now that they were good an fat
The group is able to fashion a new axle for it to work temporarily, hopefully getting far enough to a point that they can put a good fix to it
Aya asks MA-TCHES to break down Aya's slave cuff as she wishes to enter a new city as a free person and no longer a slave
The group does not hear the footsteps approach, but a disembodied voice calls from the woods "there's noooo fucking way, this contintent is tooo small. What luck do we have today boys!? We are in for a treat this evening... what a conversation we are going to have" - Bis and Carric recognize this voice as [[Mozu]]
Carric immediately lunges at the voice //grapples and attempts to grab

### Session 26 - 20220928
#### Date Start: May 1 - 11 pm
#### Date End: May 2 - 8 pm
#### Story Teller: Bis (Ashlynne) == attempted to give what she thought happened
Hearing the voice, Bis breaks out in a literal rage, her wild magic causing wild tendrals to lash out
Dorvik has a moment of recognition and asks Malerai "what he's doing here", Malerai asks the same. Small conversation about how they are still alive takes place.
Malerai asks how his father is doing and at that Dorvik takes a shot in the direction he believes Malerai is
The group hears laughter in the woods as the sounds of voices move around them, seemingly surrounding them, although it's only the two voices
Mozu asks Carric if he's told his friends they used to work together... Carric begins shaking with anger... "ah we were friends"
Mozu brings up Bis and their past and how Bis has no one to blame but herself
Mozu and his group of people tell the group that they will leave us tonight, perhaps track us, perhaps see us another time
Bis is unable to find anything; however Dorvik finds a small brass locket with about 40/45 ft away from the cart
Bis sees him pickup the locket and recognises it, Dorvik looks it over and sees the photo inside, Bis and her father and family
Dorvik closes the locket, holds it, and slowly approaches Bis to hand her the locket
Bis takes the locket, holds it and begins crying
They talk about their history with the two beings that they just interacted with, vowing to hunt them 
Xan prepped a tea hut and has food and beverage ready to share with the group when he sees Bis and Dorvik return
The group discuss the events and Bis stats that she will have tea tonight, he presents her with the nicest cup he has and hands it to her with a cloth under it
Xan / MA-TCHES / Dorvik / Carric all take first watch
During watch, Dorvik hears voices, one he recognizes, "Havel, be careful on your journey... the path you have chosen is about become more dangerous. I fear you maybe joining me soon, and I hope it is not the case... it is too early for you... my son"
rest of watch goes off without anything additional happening apart from normal forest noises
Bis / Dorvik / MA-TCHES begin second watch, Xan turns in for the night and begin his meditations 
Dorvik hears "you need to rest, you're good to no one if you're exhausted... your companions will be needing you in the events to come"
Carric / Dorvik start the next watch but both pass out, unable to make it through the night / Aya takes next watch with MA-TCHES
Aya is in her wolf form and choose not to interact with either
Pipen tries to have a conversation with Dorvik but doesn't get anything from him so he moves to Carric for conversation. Pipen pushs Carric for a taste of tasty beverage 
The watch continues without issue; in the wind she hears "Aya, I sense something... some danger, be on your guard mother, be on your guard"... upon that, not expecting to hear that voice again, she finds the nearest bottle of wine and begins chugging
River / Xan / MA-TCHES all take final watch; 
The group wakes and readies for the last bit of the trek to Fort Torvas, Dorvik up front still with River
Xan uses his boots to help maintain his steadiness in the cart, but he attempts to continue copying a 4th level spell - successful 
During the journey, Dorvik puts his disguise hat on so it has time to attune to him for use
While travelling, River picks up that they have been drifting off in the wrong direction and corrects Dorviks direction
River and Dorvik pick up on 6 riders in the distance (uniformed armor, all the same, golds and blues rep Gilcra)
two of the riders split off looking to pass on the right, but two of them appear to be approaching our cart in our direction
the two don't stop us, but they do go past us, passing on the left, circle around and now come back on our right side
one rider questions Dorvik, questioning him and noting his exhaustion, prod-ing for info
they eventually move on without any trouble and the group continues toward Fort Torvas
The group reach the outside of Fort Torvas, they see a pair of giant statues of giant dreadnoughts made of stone, Xan begins giving the group a history lesson about the giant dreadnoughts 
Xan informs the group of the laughing unicorn and it's wonderful treats

#### Date End: May 3 - midnight
#### Story Teller: Carric (Joe)
Group arrives at [[Fort Torvas]] and are greeted by the [[Lt Cmdr Orimyse]] on duty. Things started a bit headed but Xan was able to sooth the mood and bring tensions back to a manageable level.
To the right is apparent military barricks and off to the left seem to be the family housing. First turn to the left Xan is aware that it will take us to [[The Laughing Unicorn]]
After about 100 yards, Xan asks to bring the cart to a halt
Xan called for a family meeting to discuss plans and potentially how we should be acting and what to expect
Discussed potential issues and the fact that they knew we were coming, they're aware of those that approach
Aya asks for the crystal orb and states that she's going to attempt to scry [[Mozu]] 
As the group enters the most perfect smell of bread wine mead hit with the best of smells. This run down tavern is actually what appears to be a really nice place to eat / pretty obviously hiding something
Percival Duccacuss greets us at the front door with a magnificent welcome
Xan pulls out some gold and asks for bread tea wine and whatever is for supper
Xan knows that this place doesn't really accommodate large crowds, small number of rooms for people to sleep
the group sits down to a table and is treated very well, all the drinks, all the foods
chatter about the plans to come are discussed and eventually the group grabs a room for the night at the tavern
the group settles into the limited rooms for the night; through the night, the majority of the group is woken by a laughing horse
those that open the door and attempt to see what's going on gets compelled to seek out the noises
While inspecting, the laughing gets louder as we near the kitchen
A hidden switch is found that reveals a very dark unlit hall, those with darkvision can see down into the hall, MA-TCHES is still producing light, around 20 ft in the end of the hall is visible 
Dorvik begins heading down the hallway, very much tripping over something that triggers a trap, taking 16 dmg
No more traps are found but we've reached what appears to be a storage room with nothing but rotten goods, food, and rats moving about... whatever this is, has been here for decades
The group hears a voice calling out... why ... why ... why

Then evening continued into the room at the end of the tunnel. Upon entering the room, Dorvik sees a chest and instintively takes a shot at it. At the sound of the arrow crashing into the chest, Bis throws an animal ball from one of her bags. An owl emerges as she lets go of the magical ball. 
Dorvik enters the room and attempts to figure out where the source of the sound is coming from. A slight sense to continue pressing forward pulls him more into the room.
Aya changes into the shape of an owl and lands on Bis' shoulder. Xan enters the room, eats some tots, and continues forward. River enters the room and helps Dorvik find the source of the sound. 
River finds what seems to be a pressure plate, moves the box, which triggered the plate, opening the hidden door.
River trips a tripwire, causing him to take a bit of piercing damage from darts covered in poison.
Still unable to see in the dark, Dorvik can't make anything out. However, River is able to see old, turned over cots, broken tables and chairs.
Aya flies into the room and lands on a bookcase, investigates the room, but is unable to pickup on anything. 
River casts bonfire on the table next to him and decides to follow the smoke, to see where it's going. He is able to catch the smoke attempting to escape through a small corner in the back of the room.
Bis begins to look around the rubble to see if there's anything she can sort out that may give her a clue as to what happened or what could be there
While investigating the ruble, Xan ends up tripping over a stone, causing him to drop some of hit tots.
Xan does catch some rats escaping through a hole in the wall and asks pipen to investigate. He states it smell like rat poo
Upon last investigation, Bis is able to move a rock revealing a hand sticking out of the ruble
Bis pokes at the hand, the hand reaches out and grabs her finger, while letting out a loud skretch
[[20221011_09]]
The battle ends with 
Dorvik Deaf / Blind
Xan Deaf / Blind
Aya Deaf / Blind
MA-TCHES Deaf
River Deaf
Carric Deaf
Pip Deaf
Bis
River gives Dorvik a healing potion which brings his hearing and sight back 
River looks over to Aya and he notes that she is also deaf / blind, he holds out an old fish so she knows it's him
River pulls the fish back and begins scratching behind the ears and then force feeds the potion 
Aya looks back at Xan and takes note of his current situation, noticing he seems to be afflicted as well
Xan responds telepathically that he is fine, he's able to see through Fion
Bis ends the battle dramatically low in health, but is clear of Deaf and Blind
She believes she can repair MA-TCHES, but it will take time
Carric is DEAF and lets Bis know
Pip uses lesser restoration to remove Deaf / Blind from Xan, River, and Carric
Xan - "I told you it wasn't a bad place ... "

#### Date Start: May 3 - 0030
#### Date End: May 3 - 1000
#### Story Teller: Xan (Jay)
The spectral is gone now, and the group attempts to get an idea of what happened. Not really turning up the cause of the rocks to fall in the room, the group heads back to rest
Bis attempts to repair MA-TCHES and remove his deafness
She begins probing and prod'ing, finds a few copper wires running around with what appears to be a few loose connections. She cleans up the connections and it appears to work... MA-TCHES is able to hear again
River makes drinks for him Bis and Carric, but doesn't quite make them right and notes he needs some practice
Aya creates an alive bounty for "Delvin" - 300 GP
As everyone settles in for the night, Carric hears a single shingle crash to the ground
he looks around, nothing in particular is spotted
as he's falling asleep, he hears a familiar voice "I think it's about time for you to leave, it's not going to be safe here in the next 48 hours" - sounds like Delvin
Carric states he has a lot to answer for and eventually falls to sleep
Carric wakes early and returns to the group, Xan is awake going through his morning routine
the group that slept outside moves indoors to gather up the folks inside, runs into the proprietor of the tavern.
the proprietor realizes that the building is connected to the underground escape tunnels, which is what that ruble was connected to
to show his appreciation, the owner grants the group lifetime half price room rates
the group makes their way to see the Lt Cmdr; gaining entry to the command post
the group is escorted to the Lt Cmdr's office and enter, revealing lots of medals and items on the wall
Dorvik introduces the rest of the group as they hid in the back of the cart during initial introductions; afterward hands the conversation off to Xan who then proceeds to discuss the encounter along the road with [[Mozu]] & company
She was rather interested in how we received the writ from the king and what part we played in receiving it
Aya ends up casting detect thoughts on Carric in an attempt to get a view of [[Mozu]] in order to attempt a scrying on him - she sees a cavern, a giant pit, figures hanging from rope, hearing voices of Bis shouting out, a voice of someone she doesn't recognize, she sees a figure with white eyes, a shot ring out from a bow that catches [[Mozu]] in the shoulder, figures begin falling from ropes, a red figure falls into the pit... she sees him tying down ropes, eating breakfast on the same ship, at that point the connection drops
Dorvik suggests that maybe Aya should begin casting the spell from inside a tiny hut to limit the potential for unwanted ramifications 
Aya casts the spell but unfortunately it doesn't take and brakes
Aya asks to detect thoughts on Dorvik in order to get an idea of what [[Malerai]] looks like
Aya then casts scry again in an attempt to see Malerai... the mirror begins to bubble and ripple as the spell takes hold, the waters start to turn black and light up, a white light begins to appear... greens browns greys, the group sees an image of him wearing the same outfit seen in dorviks memory, leaning against the enterence to a cave, however unsure where it is, the group recognizes that it is through the same topography the group went through "do you really thing they have any chance at bringing him back?" Aya hears a response... in the voice of Mozu... "absolutely"... "not long now"... "if master [[Edgiac]] can pull it off and bring back MAK-si-uk, that would bring back the power"
Xan recalls reading about that name... the creator - the all, one could assume, all magic was created through this entity 
Lt Cmdr speaks up and says they don't recognize the name but perhaps someone else in the town would know of it
Xan tells Aya that they need to get a message to Lady 
she responds, "it's good your safe, that's terrifying news, will attempt to send reinforcements to the fort immediately from what we can spare... lovely about your tots"
as a reward and sale of dragonhead, Lt Cmdr offers the group a few magic items
- Set of Black Dragon Scale Mail - Dorvik places the armor in the party inventory
- Oathbow - Dorvik takes the bow and gives his Longbow +2 to the party inventory
- Obsidian Steed - Nightmare - Aya received the steed
She asks what our next destination was, Xan replies that we should like to talk to a wizard to discuss being able to arrive at locations when needed
She asks if he would like to have access to the portal at Fort Torvas, which he accepts fully - the group is now granted access to their circle
Aya asks to legitimize the bounty she wrote up
she mentions that she cannot take the bounty and that it must be given to the proper channels
the group mentions the tunnel found at [[The Laughing Unicorn]] to the Lt Cmdr, who mentions they are decrepit and run down... she does not seem all to worried
the group leaves the Lt Cmdr and begin to make their way out to town

> details missed, I was afk and unable to snag some info

Xan went off and got some magic supplies
Aya was nervous about some of the happenings with the night commander so she revisited her for additional questioning
MA-TCHES visited the [[Crossed Bastian]] to pick up some new armor, a shield specifically
River and Dorvik visited the stables to sell the horses and purchase a lizard for traveling through the desert... [[Matilda's Bazaar Bazaars]]
We were able to sell the pair of horses for 100GP and purchased a lizard for 800GP after River negotiated an additional 100GP from the asking price
After the deal took place with the horses and lizard, the stable hand asked about cart upgrades
Carric has a conversation with Bis about [[Mozu]] and if there is potentially something else besides the fort, Carric has a feeling that this isn't his kind of place
Carric leaves Bis and heads off down an alleyway 
Bis looks for a quiet place to scry with her newly acquired magic item; looking for [[Saorny]]
	she sees bright white at first that slowly gets darker and darker... almost pitch black
	she sees a torch against a brick wall
	she sees her dressed in what appears to be full plate mail armor; back against the wall
	audibly she hears "I don't really care about that" 
	another muffled voice in the background which she doesn't recognize say "I always thought it'd be a good idea if we didn't always have to kill them if they didn't agree with us... if they're going to try to kill us, we'll just kill them... she can just speak with dead if we really need information"
	shadows crossing by in front of her, all sorts of different characters
	she notes... "somebodies thinking of me"
	she begins sharpening a sword with a stone
	she states "we're going to get those guys"
	someone in response says "lady saorny, I'll follow you until my dying day"
Bis looks for Carric after the spell ends
Carric listens in the city for anything happening but comes up empty
Bis finds Carric and has a discussion about her scrying for Saorny
