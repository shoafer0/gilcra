The figure calls out "I'M HERE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW, YOU ARE NO LONGER SAFE IN YOUR HOMES... GILCRA WILL FALL. THERE IS NOTHING ANY OF YOU CAN DO TO STOP ME OR MY LORD... GILCRA... WILL... FALL! IT WILL BE RAISED IN HELLFIRE TO THE GROUND! BROUGHT BACK TO WHAT IT ONCE WAS!" His hands raise to the air over his head and put his hands together. A ball of black and red begins to form above his head that grows in size. 

Dorvik shots a banishing shot, however as it gets close, it is magically deflected. River Xan Aya Carric and the town guard are all launching magic attacks at him... however nothing is getting through. 

"NOTHING YOU DO CAN STOP ME OR MY LORD [[Edgiac]]" The black orb that he hurled at the castle destroys everything in an 150 ft radius. The whole group is knocked to the floor. 

"EVERYTHING WILL BURN, NOTHING IS SACRED" - as he blinks out of existence
