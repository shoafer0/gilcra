### Bonus Actions
- ***Curving Shot***
	- When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 ft. of the original target.
- ***Second Wind***  ---  0/1 per Short Rest
	- You can use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 7 HP.
- ***Fury***  ---  200 / 200
	- *Level 1 (100 Fury)* - You imbue your ranged weapon with arcane energy, causing it to crackle at the seams with power. For the next 18 seconds, all of your ranged weapon attacks explode violently. Every creature within a 10 foot cube from point of impact, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
	- *Level 2 (200 Fury)* - Ethereal Arrows “Poor guy, he never saw it coming”  Your keen senses heighten as you can see into the Ethereal Plane for a moment, and your shots magically seek out whichever target you desire, even behind full cover, as long as you’ve seen them in the past minute. Make your ranged weapon attack rolls as normal, on a hit, the target must make a Str Save (DC16) or be pushed back 10 feet. Also, if your target has no line of sight on you for each shot you make, it counts as a sneak attack. This ability lasts until the start of your next turn.
- ***Cunning Action***
	- You can take a bonus action on each of your turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Reactions
- ***Opportunity Attack***

### Other
- ***Arcane Shot***  ---  2/2 per Short Rest
	- Twice per short rest and once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one Arcane Shot option of your choice to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll.
	- *Banishing Arrow* 
		- A creature hit by your arrow must also succeed on a CHA saving throw (DC 16) or be banished. While banished, the target’s speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. 
	- *Beguiling Arrow* 
		- A creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and is charmed by one of your allies within 30 ft. of the target if it fails a WIS saving throw (DC 16) until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.
	- *Grasping Arrow* 
		- A creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 ft., and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 ft. or more. The brambles last for 1 minute, until you use this option again, or until any creature uses an action to remove them with an Athletics check (DC 16).
- ***Sharpshooter***
	- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls and your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll to add +10 to the attack's damage.
- ***Magic Arrow***
	- Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a short bow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity, but the magic fades from the arrow on a hit or miss.
- ***Piercer*** 
	- Once per turn, you can reroll the piercing damage from an attack. On a critical hit, you can roll one additional damage die.
- ***Sneak Attack***
	- Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack with a finesse or ranged weapon if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- ***Action Surge***  ---  1/1 per Short Rest
	- You can take one additional action on your turn.
- ***Extra Attack*** 
	- You can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
- ***Thieves' Cant***
	- You have learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
- ***Lucky*** --- 3/3 per Long Rest
	- You have 3 luck points per long rest. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw (or when an attack roll is made against you), you can spend one to roll an additional d20 and you choose which die to use. You can choose to spend luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.

### Spells
- Druidcraft - 1A - 30ft
	- Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:
		- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
		- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
		- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
		- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

## History
Havel Linhart - aka Dorvik Homspire
Havel grew up in a comfortable house, without any real struggle or need in life. He has no siblings and as an only child got a lot of attention from his parents.

Oliver did not want his son to follow in his footsteps as he feared his life choices would lead to the end of his son’s life. He attempted to complete university but all that he could focus on is the adventures he was missing out on with his father. After two years of attempting and failing to focus on his studies, he surprised his parents when she reappeared at home letting them know that had dropped out, refusing to return and demanding his father take him along on his next contract.

The last job that Havel took with his father turned out to be a hit on his father and his mercenary companions, the "Silent Shield". Havel was able to escape and get away but knew there was no way his father could have made it out of the hell that was waiting for them. Instead of heading home to face his mother, as he could not bear the thought of facing her with the news, he fled to the other end of the “world”, Bitrashire. He vowed to never work with a mercenary guild again and instead took on the sole goal of avenging his father by discovering those responsible and ending their life… whoever that may be.


## Family
Havel was born to Oliver and Stacey Linhart and is an only child. Oliver, his father, is a well known mercenary who has made his living working for the rich and elite. It provides a comfortable living and his wife Stacey has never had a complaint other than the time he spends away.


## Game Revelations 
Has taken on the profession of "wine salesman", traveling from town to town looking to sell whatever wine he has on him. Not truly a high quality wine, but he certainly sells it like it is.
